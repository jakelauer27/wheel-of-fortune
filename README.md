## Background / About
  The goal of this project was to utilize Object Oriented Programming to build a fully functional wheel of fortune game. The game supports three players and guides you through each puzzle with wheel spins, vowel purchases, consonant guesses, and solve attempts. The winner through 4 rounds participates in single-player bonus round. For more on how to play, checkout the instructions in-game or read this [article](http://game-shows.chris-place.com/shows/wheel-of-fortune/how-to-play.htm.).
