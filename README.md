# Wheel-of-Fortune - Turing Mod 2 OOP Project

Enjoy a round of this three-player recreation of the classic Wheel of Fortune game. Spin the wheel with friends and 
solve the puzzles to compete for a chance to spin the bonus wheel and take home massive prizes! Or fly solo and play against a couple of AI players!

## Background / About
  The goal of this project was to utilize Object Oriented Programming to build a fully functional wheel of fortune game. As additional challenge, I added the option to play against computer players using timeOut functions to display the actions of each computer player during their turns. The game supports three players and guides you through each puzzle with wheel spins, vowel purchases, consonant guesses, and solve attempts. The winner through 4 rounds participates in single-player bonus round. For more on how to play, checkout the instructions in-game or read this [article](http://game-shows.chris-place.com/shows/wheel-of-fortune/how-to-play.htm.).
